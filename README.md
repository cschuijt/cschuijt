# Hi! 👋
I'm Casper, a free-time Ruby/Rails enthusiast now looking to take my code to the next level in [Codam](https://codam.nl)/[42](https://42network.org).

## What I'm up to
💻 I am working my way through the core curriculum in Codam, currently focusing on C++ and ray tracing.  
🏆 I am almost always working on at least one side project to broaden my skillset. Most recently, I worked on setting up a robust, anonymous voting system for the student council, and on moving my infrastructure from plain Docker/Caprover to Kubernetes.  
🔍 I am looking for part-time work! Backend and systems programming are my forte, but I'm a fast learner.

## What I've done
🤝 I have been on the Codam Student Council for a year.
📚️ Before Codam, I studied law, with a focus on administrative and European law. Public administration remains an interest of mine.  
💎 I built __[Dotagem](https://github.com/dotagem/dotagem)__, a Telegram bot that allows users to link their Steam and Telegram accounts together, letting them display Dota 2 match and profile data in any chat.
🛠️ In the 42 curriculum, I have built my own [2D game](https://github.com/cschuijt42/so_long) and a [shell](https://github.com/cschuijt42/minishell), all from scratch.

### My 42 curriculum stuff

I have moved my 42 projects to a separate organization. You can find them [here!](https://github.com/cschuijt42)
