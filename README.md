# Hi! ðŸ‘‹
I'm Casper, I do DevOps and software engineering work for [Itzos](https://itzos.com)/[KPN Health](https://kpn.com/health). I studied at [Codam Coding College](https://codam.nl), part of the 42 network.

DevOps is my current area of expertise: I build and operate [Vloot](https://vloot.dev), my own Kubernetes cluster on bare metal servers. Ruby on Rails is my go-to for web development, but over the years, I have worked in C, C++, Python, Java and TypeScript.

I don't like the idea of Microsoft using my code to train Copilot (and I like a challenge), so I self-host a [Forgejo instance](https://forge.vloot.dev/explore). Some of my personal and Codam projects can be found there.
