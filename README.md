# Hi!
I'm Casper Schuijt, a free-time Ruby/Rails enthusiast now looking to take my code to the next level in [Codam](https://codam.nl)/[42](https://42network.org).

## My own stuff
* __[ðŸ’Ž Dotagem](https://github.com/dotagem/dotagem)__, a Telegram bot running on Rails that allows users to link their Steam and Telegram accounts together, letting them display Dota 2 match and profile data in any chat.

A complete overview of my work should be on my [website](https://cschuijt.nl).
