# Hi!
I'm Casper Schuijt, a free-time Ruby/Rails enthusiast now looking to take my code to the next level in [Codam](https://codam.nl)/[42](https://42network.org).

## My own stuff
* __[ðŸ’Ž Dotagem](https://github.com/dotagem/dotagem)__, a Telegram bot running on Rails that allows users to link their Steam and Telegram accounts together, letting them display Dota 2 match and profile data in any chat.

### I am currently working on...
* Building the backend for an app to run and manage competitions and tournaments (Rails, JSON:API, Docker)
* C++ modules in the 42 curriculum
* 3D rendering and building my own raytracer from scratch

## My 42 curriculum stuff

I have moved my 42 projects to a separate organization. You can find them [here!](https://github.com/cschuijt42)
